# PyctureFrame

This is a small project we had to do for university. It displays (on full screen) the images from the configured folder and changes them after a while.
It will automatically resize and crop your images depending on your screen resolution.

It is ment to be used in small machines like Raspberry Pi to show pomos on a screen.

Dependancies:
* Python Imaging Library
* threading
* Tkinter
